This code is the basic implementation of the Normalized Freebase Distance, presented at the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2014.

To be able to run the code, you need a Freebase SPARQL endpoint.
If you want to set it up yourself, you can download the RDF triples here: https://developers.google.com/freebase/data
You can use Virtuoso to query the triples.
There is currently no public SPARQL endpoint for Freebase. 
Freebase used the MQL language for querying.
